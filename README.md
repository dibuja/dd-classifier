# Using a DD-Classifier to predict heart failures

Project performed within the scope of the course "Multivariate Analysis" at EAFIT University. The project consists of utilising different configurations of the DD-Classifier for clustering a population based on their risk to suffer a heart failure.

DD-classifiers are non-parametrical classifiers based on the concept of statistical depth and DD-plots. Different measures of depth (Mahalanobis, Tukey, Likelihood) were used and compared. 

The tools and theory employed in the project are based on the [work of J. Li, J. Cuesta-Albertos and R. Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254281536_DD-Classifier_Nonparametric_Classification_Procedure_Based_on_DD-Plot).

The data has been obtained from [this kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asgharalikhan/mortality-rate-heart-patient-pakistan-hospital).
