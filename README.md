# multivariate-analysis

Project performed within the scope of the course "Multivariate Analysis" at EAFIT University. The project consists of utilising different configurations of the DD-Classifier for clustering a population based on their risk to suffer a heart failure.

DD-classifiers are non-parametrical classifiers based on the concept of statistical depth and DD-plots. Different measures of depth (Mahalanobis, Tukey, Likelihood) were used and compared.

The data has been obtained from [this kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asgharalikhan/mortality-rate-heart-patient-pakistan-hospital).
